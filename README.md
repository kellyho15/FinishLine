# FinishLine

I used Selenium to extract data on athletic shoes and customer reviews from Finish Line. I was interested in the topic because of the increasing trend in athleisure, where casual footwear is being incorporated into all styles of dressing. This growing demand in sneakers has created a competitive environment for major footwear brands.

I was able to identify pricing, pipeline, and campaign strategies used by Adidas for successful market growth.
